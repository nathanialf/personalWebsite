I suppose "burnout" is not an entirely correct term for how I am feeling. I have for the longest time been
creatively bankrupt. It happened at some point in my teens or so, around the time I started to learn
programming. I was always drawing as a kid and played music in school but when programming came into my life I
started
channel more energy into that field for my career. I chose programming/computer science to be an extension and
medium for my own creative outlet and have yet to show anything for it.
<br>
Perhaps what I had for creativity in my youth was just not good and automatically is filtered out due to either
pre-conceived notions of what's good or what's possible
<br>
<br>
I have this strong desire to put some beautiful creation into the world through programming but my fear is that
I am unable to get to have the creative thought to develop.

<br>
This page is just trying to get my ideas out about my problem and hopefully find some solace and creative energy
I have lost.
