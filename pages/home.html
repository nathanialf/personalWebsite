I am currently a Systems Development Engineer transitioning back into a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services. 
My current career goal is to start developing and supporting video games. As I work toward this goal, I have been working in 
the GameTech Services at AWS where I am supporting the acquired company GameSparks as we shut it down and work towards releasing 
the new Amazon GameSparks.<br><br>
